# AbcDeep

This module was supposed to be a wrapper around TensorFlow to simplify the creation of Deep Learning research programs. I never had time to finish this project but I'm still releasing the source code in case that inspire someone.

The module require the following dependencies:
 * tensorflow 1.0
 * tqdm
